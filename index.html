        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Chatchawan L Suwaratana.
        <br>
            I’m an aspiring web developer from Austin, Texas. I'm studying JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery at breakneck speeds. I only started weeks ago and I've already learned so much! I’m currently making small video games and web apps that I find fun. My passion is to imbue a sense of whimsicality into everything I create.<br>
        <br>
            I'm most interested in working with a team of experienced developers to learn best how to create. I have a lot of skills to accrue, and working with others is how I learn best. A team-centric work environment pushes me to do my best. I enjoy supporting, impressing and -sometimes- competing with teammates!

        <h3>What I Like To Do</h3>
        <p>
          When I'm in the mood to be creative (and that happens a lot) I have several outlets for that mood. My current projects are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sculpting a model of Goldie from Animal Crossing so that I can put an NFC chip in the base and pretend I bought an amiibo</li>
          <li>Learning how to draw human anatomy with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB_SW4ry4DM&list=PLB5nUgozRxF-ak_GHT1_z9qrZ0Cp5ZTJi" target="_blank">these</a> video tutorials.</li>
          <li>Styrene model making, inspired by my hero, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfvtGrhYk0I" target="_blank">Adam Savage</a></li>
          <li>Putting together a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GWzHb4Hd8Y">hot wire foam cutter</a>. This one is very daunting, because it involves skills I haven't perfected, like soldering.</li>
          <li>Woodworking! I love making things from free wood I get from construction sites. Things I've made include:
            <ul>
              <li>TV stand</li>
              <li>Nightstand</li>
              <li>Bathroom shelf</li>
              <li>Two-tiered kitchen spice shelf</li>
              <li>Straight-backed chair</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Making tea</li>
          <li>Making VRChat avatars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also enjoy video games and D&D. Both serve as great social channels to hang out with my friends and family in virtual 
          spaces. There's really nothing like beating your wife's Beat Saber score to really make your day complete.

        <h3>What am I doing?</h3>
        <p>
          Besides being a student at Thinkful and learning how to code in JavaScript, I'm learning how to create custom VRChat avatars 
          in Blender, and planning on providing comissions when my skil
          in Blender, and planning on providing commissions when my skills are sufficient. Many people prefer a personal presence in 
          VRChat, and the desire is not unique to that platform.<br>
          In an age of social distancing, we may see VR environments being the norm for social hangouts. Personalised and even 
          reality-mimicing avatars could soon be in great demand.<br>
          Services I would offer may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Full custom avatars, sculpting, modeling, rigging, topology</li>
                <li>Avatar changes, fixes</li>
                <li>Animation</li>
                <li>Prop modeling</li>
                <li>Visual effects</li>

        <h3>Example App</h3>
        <p>
          This application creates an array of homework questions. The function to run it is worded as 
          "createHomework(operator,minNum,maxNum,numberOfProblems)" so you can see that it can create 
          a wide range of homework problems. I'm still working on how exactly to give it those inputs 
          through the browser, but I'll learn soon.<br>
          This app was built for homeschoolers. I grew up as one myself, and I remember my mother running 
          out of homework to give us. With an expanded set of inputs, any math problems can be procedurally 
          generated to create infinite homework. Oh joy! :D<br>
